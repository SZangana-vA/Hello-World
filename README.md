# Hello-World
A story of the beginning.

This but a chapter of my journey. A journey of developing into something Over myself. To reach that vision I have seen myself living. The lesson is that once such a dream is aquired, one must not stop developing. You must continue to an even higher plane. Thus is the law of the universe. Energy never rests. It is always moving even to the sub atomic level. But what is amazing about this grand journey is that you choose it's course. You can choose to rise, to grow, to develop into your greater self or you can not. That is the gift the universe has given to us. The will to choose. The will to rise. The will of the spirit.
